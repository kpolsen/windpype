What the code does
------------------
:python:`windpype` is a tool for characterizing fluctuations in wind power production. 
It takes time series of wind power produced and identifies up and down ramps. 
Quantifying these is critical for a correct estimate of the flexibility demands required by the fluctuating wind power.


Some examples
-------------
The code can currently identify ramps either using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) or a Swinging Door Algorithm (SDA). 

In the figure below, the FFT is divided into a low and a high frequency part, and each is used to find (down) ramps of 
different durations, either long duration (red areas) or short duration (blue areas).

In the next figure, the SDA approach is used to first compress the data, then select sections of linear 
ramping up (green dashed line) or down (red dashed line). A nice description of the SDA can be found in 
[this video presentation by OSIsoft, LLC](https://youtu.be/89hg2mme7S0).
